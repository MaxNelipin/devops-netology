maxn@docker-nm:~/terraform$ terraform init -backend-config="access_key=D01ioxB0yMXoAF9jruEQ" -backend-config="secret_key=bQgASWCRUrGMav_TzNCtxrp-WJsSEIz7tI2WTESd" -migrate-state

Initializing the backend...
Backend configuration changed!

Terraform has detected that the configuration specified for the backend
has changed. Terraform will now check for existing state in the backends.



Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of yandex-cloud/yandex from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed yandex-cloud/yandex v0.64.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
